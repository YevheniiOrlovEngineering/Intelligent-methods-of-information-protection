# NumPy Two Layer Perceptron

### Purpose

To gain a quality understanding of basic perceptrons and what makes them peform so well,
I constructed one from scratch with NumPy. This 2LP is in no way intended to replace popular DL frameworks 
such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, 
*it is instead meant to serve as an instructional tool.*
